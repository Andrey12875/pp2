# What does an if statement evaluate?  - A condition that results in True or False

# What will happen if the condition in an if statement is False? - The code block will be skipped

# What is required for proper if statement syntax in Python? - Indentation for the code block

# Print "Hello World" if a is greater than b. -  if a > b: print()

# What does the elif keyword mean? - If the previous conditions were not true, try this condition

# What happens when Python finds a true condition in an if-elif chain? - It executes that block and skips the rest

# How many elif statements can you have? - As many as you need

# Print "1" if a is equal to b, print "2" if a is greater than b, otherwise print "3".

# When does the else statement execute? - When the if condition (and any elif conditions) are False

# Can you have an else statement without an elif? - Yes

# Where must the else statement be placed? - Last in the if-elif-else chain

# What will be the result of the following code: - Welcome

# What is another name for the one-line if/else statement? - Conditional expression (ternary operator)

# What is the correct syntax for a ternary operator? - value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

# Use the correct one line short hand syntax to print "YES" if a is equal to b, otherwise print("NO").

# What does the and operator require? - Both conditions must be True

# What does the or operator require? - At least one condition must be True

# What does the not operator do? - Reverses the boolean value

# Print "Hello" if a is equal to b, and c is equal to d. - and

# Print "Hello" if a is equal to b, or if c is equal to d. - or

# Use an if statement to print "YES" if either a or b is equal to c. - if a == c or b == c:

# What is a nested if statement? - An if statement inside another if statement

# When does an inner if statement run? - Only if the outer condition is True

# Can nested if statements be replaced with logical operators? - Sometimes, depending on the logic

# What does the pass statement do? - It's a null operation - nothing happens

# Why is the pass statement useful? - To serve as a placeholder for future code

# Can you use only a comment inside an if statement without pass? - No, it will cause an error

# Which character can be used as a default case value in a match statement? - _
