# mylist = ['apple', 'banana', 'banana', 'cherry'] print(mylist[2]) - banana

# True or False. List items cannot be removed after the list has been created. - False

# mylist = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] print(mylist[-1]) - cherry

# Print the second item in the fruits list.  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] - print(fruits[1])

# mylist = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'kiwi'] print(mylist[1:4]) - ['banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

# mylist = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] mylist[0] = 'kiwi' print(mylist[1]) - banana

# Change the value from "apple" to "kiwi", in the fruits list. fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# mylist = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] mylist.insert(0, 'orange') print(mylist[1]) - apple

# Use the append method to add "orange" to the fruits list. fruits.append("orange") Use the insert method to add "lemon" as the second item in the fruits list.fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] fruits.insert(1, "lemon")

# What is a List method for removing list items? - pop()

# What is a correct syntax for looping through the items of a list? - for x in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']:  print(x)

# Consider the following code: fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] newlist = [x for x in fruits if x == 'banana'] What will be the value of newlist? - x = ["banana"]

# What is a correct syntax for sorting a list? - mylist.sort()

# You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, but what is the index number of the first item? - 0

# You cannot change the items of a tuple, but there are workarounds. Which of the following suggestion will work? - Convert tuple into a list, change item, convert back into a tuple.

#SETS

# myset = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}

# False

# True or False. A set cannot have two items with the same value.

# Select the correct function for returning the number of items in a set: - len(fruits)
